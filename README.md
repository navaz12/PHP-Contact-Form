PHP Contact Form
================

A contact form made with PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript.

The front-end is built using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap "Twitter Bootstrap") and is therefore responsive. It can however be adapted to be used on any website.

Instructions
------------

Follow these instructions to get the form working:

1. Fork and clone the repo!
2. Go to http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha and press 'Sign up Now', enter a domain name and press 'Create Key'.
3. In the contact.php file, go to line 104 and add your public key in between the quotes.
4. In the mail.php file, go to line 8 and add your private key in between the quotes.
5. Upload all files to a server with the PHP mail() extension installed to use.

Feel free to make a pull request if you want to make improvements.
